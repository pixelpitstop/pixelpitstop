# Jayasuryaa Chandrasekar

Applied AI Engineer building intelligent, end-to-end systems that combine **data, machine learning, and software engineering**.

My work spans applied ML, emerging deep learning workflows, and production-oriented AI systems — with hands-on experience across temporal, behavioural, and performance-critical data.

---

## What I’m Working On
- Applied machine learning on real-world datasets (temporal, behavioural, structured)
- Designing ML systems with strong evaluation, diagnostics, and explainability
- Expanding into deep learning and representation learning for complex data
- Full-stack integration of AI models into usable products

## Selected Projects

### ⚡ Electricity Demand Forecasting
End-to-end ML pipeline for electricity demand prediction with extensive feature engineering, lag modeling, and gradient-boosted trees.  
Achieved **~40% RMSE improvement** over baseline with detailed error analysis and SHAP-based explainability.

**Tech:** Python, pandas, numpy, XGBoost, SHAP

---

### 🏎️ F1 AI Telemetry Analyzer
AI-driven Formula 1 telemetry analysis system built on **12GB+ of FastF1 data**.  
Delivered **97.8% model accuracy** and **0.49s lap-time MAE**, producing corner-level performance insights using a physics-aware ML pipeline.

**Tech:** FastF1, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib

---

### 🌍 Urban Thermal Equity Index (UTEI)
Built the **first IoT sensor prototype** for urban heat inequality analysis at MS Swaminathan Research Foundation.  
Collected **150+ field readings**, developed the data-processing pipeline, and co-authored the research methodology for an upcoming publication.

**Tech:** ESP8266 (NodeMCU), DHT22, Arduino, Python, pandas, early ML + GIS workflows

---

### 🧠 Financial Micro-Fraud Detection (Research)
Designed a multi-layered ML + behavioural analytics framework to detect **salami slicing micro-fraud**.  
Integrated anomaly detection, clustering, blockchain logging, and real-time risk scoring.

**Outcome:** Co-author of a UK copyright-registered research work.

## Engineering Philosophy
I focus on **signal over noise** — models that generalize, metrics that matter, and systems that survive real-world data.

I value clean abstractions, explainability, and AI systems that work beyond notebooks.

---

## Looking Ahead
I’m building toward **top-tier AI / ML engineering roles**, with a long-term focus on scalable, high-impact intelligent systems across domains.
